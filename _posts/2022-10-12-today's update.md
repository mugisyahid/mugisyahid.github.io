I hate this [302](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302) API. it's back and forth for some API.

The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 302 Found redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location header.
