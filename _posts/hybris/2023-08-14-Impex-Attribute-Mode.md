* Append [mode = append] : the value we provide for that attribute gets appended next to the already existing value(s) of the attribute in itemtype.

* Replace [mode = replace] : used when we want to replace the old value of attribute with the new value in impex.

* Remove [mode = remove]: delete the entire instance of an itemtype.
