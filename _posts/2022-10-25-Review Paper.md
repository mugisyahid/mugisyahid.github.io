NOTES: ALL OF THIS WAS NOT PROPERTIES OF MINE. 
JUST TAKING KEYPOINT HERE
## Paper 1

#### Scrum Benefit
Scrum helps to fulfill the customerâ€™s requirements by interacting with the client and developer.

* Quick feedback to CR

#### Scrum Challanges [14, 15]

* coordination [18, 19, 20]

combination of integration of tasks to reach a specified goal.

    * ineffective communication
    * misunderstanding
    * lack of knowledged of requirement -> need efficient understanding of task and user requirement [16, 17]

* team size [23, 24]

Teams model:
    * Isolated Scrum team
    * Distributed Scrum of Scrum
    * Fully Integrated Scrum team
    * etc

This category need a lot of attention in ealry stage of the project [21, 22]


* change request, 
* complexity,

complexity

    * task complexity
    * story point complexity

usually select the easy one and ultimateliy left the complex task at end and affect project completion [25, 26]

* issues in daily meeting sessions.

Enhance communication:
- Sprint planning meetings
- Daily sprint meetings
- Retrospective meetings.


* Change of Request [30 - 32]

Need to define process for managing and approving changes in the project.

Due to these factors mostly the cost and time exceed scrum-based projects.


#### Main Goals 

 To overcome these issues from the accurate and precise estimation in the scrum project we have developed a web-based software system to estimate the effort of a user story as well as the budget.


#### Method

 * survey to multiple software industries
 * 30 hypotheses
 * set age criteria to get option to most exp programmer



#### Result

 * Key chalenging factor
 * existing scrum cost estimation techniques are not pertinent for projects.
 * a framework as solution


#### Conclusion

* new concept of estimation that facilitate the client, software industry, and developers as well to meet the requirements of the client
* fulfill the changes during the sprints/s development 
* deliver the project within the time and cost.




#### Keypoints

* Software Project Management is a combination of different processes like planning, organizing, controlling, and interaction between members.

* Agile software methodology is widely used in software industries due to its flexible and dynamic nature. the project is developed in different iterations and there is a quick response to changes.

* Scrum is the most important and trendy component of agile methodology in industry and research. -> [find the reference]


* Scrum characteristics: -> [find the reference]
    * team self-determination, self-organized team
    * quick response to changes
    * flexibility in nature
    * promote interaction between team members
    * work in sprints and daily meeting sessions

* Scrum has been found very effective and efficient with small-scale and co-located teams. -> [find the reference]


#### Scrum chalanges -> [find the reference]
* There is no effective technique or approach that formulates to coordinate work with co-located teams
* there is also no proper technique or method to organize and manage the internal dependencies, these dependencies become a cause of project failure.


#### Literature

##### Agile scrum methodology
* Priority are customer satisfaction & Involve Customer in Development. [1, 2]
* most in use are scrum [3, 4]


##### Scrum steps -> [find the reference]
* creating product backlog
* prioritized list of feature
* requirement to each of feature



#### Estimation Tech

##### Non-algorithmic based method


* Planning Poker

Team member discous cost and effort estimation. Issue:

    * less accurate when there is a lack of previous experience with the same projects.
    * The anchoring effect, it will depent on knowledge, experience, and individual skill. it has deep impact and influence.
    * Domination. Most experience determine all
    * need to have viewpoint from highly extensive, skilled, experince person

* Wideband Delphi
Focus on interaction between team members. interaction and communication are essential priciple for development.
Issue:

    * required extensive skills and experience Peo- ple and opinions can be biased by providing irrelevant information.
    * most human judgments are not repeatable and reusable.

* Expert judgment method

only discussion between expert.
carries the same issue.


##### Algorithm based methods

* Story Point

Unit of software size amd intiuitive combination of complexity and inherent risk developemnt. Use to estimate the size.

Issue:

    * no specifict tool or procedure for the selection / priority of user stories. it's purely based on estimator -> need estimator that have sufficient knowledge & skill

    * inflate the story point. the team underpressure to achieve more story point. higher velocity and create low quaility of work

    * 

* Use Case Point

* Velocity

* SLOC


CHECK THE TABLE, feature and issue of existing methods



#### Proposed cost estimation technique

There is a strong need to propose an Estimation technique after examining the Literature Review and survey results that will be a predictive base.


* Find out the demography of Teams Members -> hand out the form. PM to review. -> reduce coordination and communication gap which removes experts' biaasness (planning poker issue).


Category of Module:

* easy vs complex
