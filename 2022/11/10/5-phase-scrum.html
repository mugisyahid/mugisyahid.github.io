<h1 id="scrum-phase">Scrum Phase</h1>

<p>Benefits of using Scrum phases for project management
Scrum is a popular framework across many industries because it can be extremely effective when applied correctly. Some benefits of using this framework with your team include:</p>

<h3 id="effective-prioritization">Effective prioritization</h3>
<p>The backlog system that Scrum uses helps make it easy for you to assign different priorities to different components of a project. This allows you to better focus your resources on the most important elements to ensure that teams complete all necessary tasks according to your intended plans.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-clarity">Organizational clarity</h3>
<p>A Scrum framework keeps all staff members informed about your expectations and the overall plans for a project. Scrum systems typically include a daily check-in and provide staff with the opportunity to give updates and ask questions.
Open lines of communication: The Scrum framework also provides ample opportunity for communication, both with senior members of the team and peers. This can make it easy for team members to seek help when needed in order to complete their work more efficiently and keep the project on schedule and on budget.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-adaptation">Rapid adaptation</h3>
<p>The Scrum process features the ability to make adjustments quickly when needed and includes several elements of reflection and analysis. This allows you to more easily identify areas where you require changes and more quickly put those changes into effect for the benefit of the project.</p>
<h3 id="guided-performance-analysis">Guided performance analysis</h3>
<p>The Scrum process includes systems for reviewing performance throughout both a Scrum project and the multiple sprints contained within it. This framework provides a guide when performing reflection in order to help you come to more accurate and actionable conclusions.</p>

<p>5 Scrum phases of effective project management
Consider these common Scrum phases of effective project management:</p>

<h3 id="1-initiation">1. Initiation</h3>
<p>The initiation phase of a Scrum framework is the period in which you create a vision for your project. This includes important identification points, such as noting who the stakeholders are for the project and assigning the role of Scrum Master to yourself or another member of the team responsible for executing the plan. This is also the period in which you assign team members to the project in order to create your team.</p>

<p>During initiation, you determine the confines of your epic, which is the overall project your team is working toward. You also construct the backlog for the project, which comprises all the elements your team must complete in order to finish the project.</p>

<h3 id="2-planning-and-estimation">2. Planning and estimation</h3>
<p>During this phase, you create plans for a sprint, which is a short, time-boxed period that can help your team collaborate more effectively. As your team completes each sprint, you can then combine them later to complete all necessary elements in the project backlog. Consider selecting relevant items from the backlog and moving them into your sprint backlog when creating the plans.</p>

<p>You can also use this time to create estimates about your expectations for the sprint, including what your team will deliver and when. This provides clear expectations for all members of the team for the duration of the sprint. You may also repeat this process multiple times throughout the course of a project until it’s finished.</p>

<h3 id="3-implementation">3. Implementation</h3>
<p>The implementation phase is when you and your team implement the sprint as planned. During this phase, you maintain an updated backlog, removing items as staff complete them and assigning out new items from the backlog as needed. Consider meeting to provide project updates and review the work plans or concerns. During this meeting, encourage staff to ask questions, make requests or submit important notes that could be valuable for the other members to hear. Just as with the planning and estimation phase, you can also repeat this process multiple times until the project is complete.</p>

<h3 id="4-reviewing">4. Reviewing</h3>
<p>To get feedback, consider scheduling a review meeting with your team at the end of the project to discuss the sprint. This meeting provides an opportunity to discuss what went well and where there are areas for improvement based on the results of the completed sprint. It allows you to adjust processes and procedures in order to be successful when transitioning into the next planning and estimation phase.</p>

<p>The review meeting also provides team members working on the project an opportunity to present the results of their contribution to the current sprint. This can allow the team to work together to brainstorm ideas for further improvements, or to analyze the implementation capabilities of the completed work into the larger project. This allows you to determine if you can remove completed tasks from the backlog, or if you need to add them back. If there’s additional work to be done, consider repeating this step just as you would during the planning, estimation and implementation steps.</p>

<h3 id="5-releasing">5. Releasing</h3>
<p>The last phase is the release phase, in which you deliver any final products to stakeholders, such as bringing a product to market or providing a client with the developed technology. After releasing the product, consider organizing a project retrospective meeting with your team to analyze the performance of each individual sprint and to discuss the overall performance of the project. Identifying areas that work efficiently and areas of struggle can help you identify what to aim for and what to avoid on future Scrums in order to get the maximum benefit out of your next project.</p>
